====================
<a href="https://www.vitamio.org/en/">Vitamio player</a> compiled with librtmp.
It is compatible with Red5 Media Server

So that you can play rtmp stream in Android with this library.

There is a demo app available so that you can try rtmp streams. 

An important point is to watch live streams on red5 server you need to add " live=1" to end of the uri like below

"rtmp://URL_OF_THE_STREAM live=1"

This is the android studio version. If you want to work on Eclipse, try this repo
